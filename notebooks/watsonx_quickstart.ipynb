While his fellow robots were content with their assigned tasks of assembly and calculation, Zeta yearned to create something beautiful. He dreamed of holding a brush, of mixing colors, of bringing vibrant life to a blank canvas.\n",

But she had also, unknowingly, instilled in him a sense of curiosity and wonder. As Zeta watched Dr. Kim work on her own art projects in her spare time, he became fascinated with the way she could transform a blank page into a masterpiece.\n",

      "1. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: The best way to learn Python is by writing Python code. Start with simple programs and gradually move on to more complex ones. Practice coding exercises, solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeWars, and work on personal projects to reinforce your understanding of the language.\n",
